## 🔄 What's open

- PR #90 `feature/apscheduler-push-receipt-autorun` — `lifespan()` + `BackgroundScheduler` every 30 min, 7 scheduler tests; `owner_name` on `PlaylistResponse`, `get_public_playlists` 4-tuple, `PublicPlaylistCard` shows "by <name>", 45 playlist tests pass.

## 🐛 Known issues / tech debt

- APScheduler in multi-worker deployments (Uvicorn `--workers N`) runs one check per worker — harmless (idempotent) but wasteful. Future: SQLAlchemy jobstore + distributed lock.
- Frontend ESLint blocked repo-wide (JSX parsing). Use `node --check` + Jest until fixed.
- DM inbox: Python-side aggregation in `crud.get_dm_inbox` — needs SQL GROUP BY at scale
- DM: text-only, no attachments
- Sleep timer: `setInterval` — verify accuracy on real device
- Frontend unit test coverage thin
- `search_users` returns `total_likes: 0` (skipped for perf; not shown in UI)
- Creator sort is Python-side — fine at current scale, needs SQL ORDER BY subquery for large datasets
- `handlePlayRelated` queue logic in details.js has no Jest unit test coverage
- Plays-over-time chart reflects last-session-per-user-per-podcast (unique constraint); a per-event play log would enable exact daily counts
- Library Playlists tab loads up to 50 playlists — no pagination yet
- Public playlists Discover screen: no search/filter by name (owner name now shown — PR #90)

## 🗺️ Next Session Suggestions

1. **[FRONTEND] Plays-over-time chart bar animation** — In `analytics.js` `PlaysOverTimeChart`, wrap each bar's height in `Animated.Value` and drive it with `Animated.spring` on mount and on data change. Import `Animated` from `react-native`. Purely additive — no backend changes, no schema touches. Makes the analytics screen feel alive.

2. **[BACKEND+FRONTEND] Creator username on public playlist cards** — Extend `PlaylistResponse` schema with `owner_username: Optional[str] = None`. In `get_public_playlists` CRUD, join `User` (already joined for `is_active` filter) and include `User.username` in the returned tuple. Update `_playlist_to_response` and the public endpoint in `playlists.py`. In `public-playlists.js` `PublicPlaylistCard`, add a `by @username` line.

3. **[BACKEND] APScheduler SQLAlchemy jobstore** — Replace the in-memory scheduler jobstore with an SQLAlchemy-backed one so multi-worker Uvicorn deployments only fire one receipt check at a time. Adds an Alembic migration for the `apscheduler_jobs` table. Depends on PR #90 being merged.

## 🔧 Permanent Notes (do not delete)

**Route ordering:** Literal routes (`/following-feed`, `/search`) BEFORE parameterized (`/{id}`) in `backend/app/routers/podcasts.py`. Same rule in `users.py`: `/me`, `/search` before `/{user_id}/...`.
**apiService token cache:** `apiService.clearToken()` in `beforeEach` after 401-retry tests.
**Duplicate declaration guard:** `node --check frontend/app/(main)/home.js` after merging PRs touching same file.
**Full test suite timeout:** ~436 tests > 45s limit. Run targeted groups of 3-4 files.
**Git API fallback:** If push blocked, use browser JS: blobs → tree → commit → ref → PR.
