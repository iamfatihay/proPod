## Current State

**Last updated:** 2026-05-07
**Last session (7):** Guest post-session summary -- branch `feature/guest-session-summary` wires HmsRoom leave details into the guest live invite summary view (PR pending)
**Test suite baseline:** ~486 backend tests

**Tech stack:** React Native + Expo Router + NativeWind frontend; FastAPI + SQLAlchemy backend; PostgreSQL (prod) / SQLite (local and test)

**MVP priority:** The most important product goal is reliable podcast creation plus multi-host remote recording. The app needs to let users in different countries and network conditions join the same session, talk smoothly, and finish with a high-quality usable recording before broader feature work takes precedence.

> Full shipped history (PR #1--#65) lives in `docs/SHIPPED_ARCHIVE.md`.

## Open / In-Progress

- `feature/guest-session-summary` -- guest live invite session summary ready for PR.

---

## Known Tech Debt

- Sleep timer uses `setInterval`; verify timing accuracy on real devices.
- Frontend unit-test coverage is still thin in several user-facing flows.
- `search_users` returns `total_likes: 0` by design for performance; UI should not depend on it.
- Creator sorting is still Python-side; acceptable at current scale.
- `handlePlayRelated` queue logic in `frontend/app/(main)/details.js` lacks focused Jest coverage.
- Share web pages still contain placeholder CTA behavior and need production-ready app-open/download handling.
- Full test suite timeout: ~486 tests exceeds the practical sandbox budget; run targeted groups of 3-4 files max.

---

## Validation Notes

- Frontend ESLint is no longer blocked by JSX parsing; targeted lint is valid again.
- 2026-05-07: `cd frontend && npx eslint app/live.js` passed for guest session summary changes; Node emitted the existing package module-type warning.
- Prefer focused validation only: a few pytest files max on backend, and targeted lint or `node --check` for frontend JS files.
- Do not report validation as passing unless it actually ran.

## Next Session Suggestions

1. **RTC join timeout UX** -- the 15s join timeout in HmsRoom shows a static error; add a retry button so users can attempt to rejoin without navigating away.
2. **RTC session list screen** -- expose `listRtcSessions` on the frontend so hosts can review past live sessions and their recording status.
3. **Guest summary polish** -- verify the post-session summary on device and consider showing host/session status if backend invite/session status is available.

---

## Permanent Notes

- Route ordering: literal routes (`/following-feed`, `/search`) must be before parameterized (`/{id}`) in `backend/app/routers/podcasts.py`.
- `apiService.clearToken()` in `beforeEach` after 401-retry tests.
- Run `node --check frontend/app/(main)/home.js` after merging PRs touching that file.
- If working from roadmap/TODO docs, verify against code before acting.
